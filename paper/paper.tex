\section{Introduction}

This paper has three aims. Firstly, it shall introduce the shallow water equations and describe how finite volume methods can be used to compute a numerical solution. Secondly, it shall explore two such methods, the Lax-Friedrich and the Local-Lax-Friedrich (Rusanov) methods, describing them conceptually via equations and concretely via code snippets. The code is organized to map to the concepts as cleanly as possible and to leverage higher-order programming techniques and patterns. Finally, the code shall be used to generate solutions to several model problems, which can be examined in order to gain insight into the concept and consequences of numerical viscosity. 

\section{Shallow Water Equations}


The shallow water equations are a system of hyperbolic partial differential equations which are effective at describing the behavior of tsunamis and overland flooding. They are derived from the general Navier-Stokes equations by making the following assumptions:

\begin{itemize}
\item In the 1-D case, the flow is in a channel of unit width
\item Horizontal velocity $u(x)$ across any cross section $x$ is constant
\item Vertical velocity $v(x)$ is small (but not zero) and falls out of the equations
\item Pressure is dominated by hydrostatics: $p=\frac{1}{2}\rho gh^2$
\end{itemize}

The 1D equations are as follows:

\[
\begin{bmatrix}h \\ hu \end{bmatrix}_t + \begin{bmatrix}hu \\ hu^2 + \frac{1}{2}gh^2\end{bmatrix}_x = 0 \]

This paper chooses the state variables $q := (h, hu)$ to form a state space, $Q$. This can be expressed in code as follows:
\begin{verbatim}
const Float = Float64

mutable struct Q
    h :: Float
    hu :: Float
end
\end{verbatim}


There are several tradeoffs associated with this representation of state space. In performance-critical code, the choice of data structure is driven primarily by memory access patterns, which are not considered here. The principal benefit of this representation is that it moves some of the semantics of the problem domain into the type system, which would permit future extensions such as awareness of physical units. On the other hand, this representation is unaware of the fact that $Q$ forms a vector space, resulting in duplicated, messier, and possibly less efficient code. 

This latter problem may be resolved quickly, as Julia uses \emph{multimethods}. Multimethods 

\begin{verbatim}
import Base.+
import Base.-
import Base.*

function +(lhs::Q, rhs::Q)
    Q(lhs.h + rhs.h, lhs.hu + rhs.hu)
end

function -(lhs::Q, rhs::Q)
    Q(lhs.h - rhs.h, lhs.hu - rhs.hu)
end

function *(a::Real, q::Q)
    Q(a*q.h, a*q.hu)
end
\end{verbatim}

The shallow water equations may be defined over this state space in an abstract way. Because they match the pattern of a general conservation law, 

\[q_t(x,t) + f(q(x,t))_x = 0\]

their dynamics may be captured as a flux function, $f$, such that 

\[f : (q_1, q_2) \mapsto \begin{bmatrix} q_2\\ q_2^2/q_1 + \frac{1}{2}gq_1^2\end{bmatrix}\]

This flux function may be expressed in Julia directly:

\begin{verbatim}
const G = 9.81f0
function f(q :: Q)
    Q(q.hu, q.hu^2/q.h + 0.5*G*q.h^2)
end
\end{verbatim}

The shallow water equations enter the numerical code in only one other place, the max wave speed function. The physical wave speeds are given by the eigenvalues of the flux Jacobian  

\[f'(q) = \begin{bmatrix}0 & 1 \\ -u^2 + gh & 2u \end{bmatrix}\]

\[\lambda_{max} = \max\ \lvert u \pm \sqrt{gh} \rvert \]


\begin{verbatim}
function wavespeed(q :: Q)
    u = q.hu / q.h
    c = sqrt(G * q.h)
    max(abs(u-c), abs(u+c))
end
\end{verbatim}
